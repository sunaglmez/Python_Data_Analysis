# Observation

An observation refers to each individual value within a data set. This is typically considered as each individual or sample in the data set being an "observation." Observations serve as fundamental units in data analysis and statistical examination processes.

## What Is an Observation?

An observation is a recorded value for each individual or sample in a data set. It should be thought of as the fundamental unit where data is collected and analyzed. Each observation represents a specific feature or measurement, and these measurements are used for data analysis.

### Examples

#### 1. Heights of People

In a data set with information about people's heights:
- Each person is considered an observation.
- For example, "Ali's height is 175 cm" and "Ay≈üe's height is 160 cm" are two different observations in the data set.
- Here, each person's height is an observation value, and these values are used to analyze people's heights.

#### 2. Students' Grades

In a school data set with students' exam grades:
- Each student is considered an observation.
- For example, "Ahmet's grade is 85" and "Zeynep's grade is 90" are two different observations in the data set.
- Each student's exam grade is an observation value, and these values are used to evaluate students' performance.

### Observation and Data Set

A data set typically contains multiple observations. Each observation represents a row or record in the data set and provides information about various features or variables. Observations are analyzed in data analysis, statistical tests, and modeling processes.

### Observation and Analysis

Observations can be used in various ways during the data analysis process:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics calculated from observations, such as mean, median, and variance, help understand the general characteristics of the data set.
- **Correlation and Regression**: Relationships between observations are analyzed to identify connections between variables.
- **Group Comparisons**: Differences and similarities between different groups of observations are analyzed.

An observation is a fundamental unit in data sets where each individual or sample is represented. These observations are used in data analysis and statistical examination processes to obtain meaningful results.
