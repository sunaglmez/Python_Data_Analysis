# Variables and Their Categories

Variables can be classified into different categories based on their characteristics. These categories determine the methods and approaches used in analyzing the variables. Generally, variables can be divided into three main categories: by structure, by value, and by cause-and-effect type.

## 1. Types of Variables by Structure

### a. Qualitative (Categorical) Variables

- **Qualitative variables** are those where data values are divided into specific categories or groups and represent non-numeric characteristics. There is generally no inherent ranking or ordering among the categories.
- **Subcategories:**
  - **Nominal Variables:** Categories have no specific order. For example, gender (Female, Male) or color (Red, Blue).
  - **Ordinal Variables:** Categories have a specific order or ranking. For example, education level (Elementary, Middle School, High School) or customer satisfaction (Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Neutral).

### b. Quantitative (Numerical) Variables

- **Quantitative variables** are those with numerical values that can be analyzed through mathematical operations. Quantitative variables can be either continuous or discrete.
- **Subcategories:**
  - **Continuous Variables:** Can take an infinite number of values within a given range. These variables can be measured with precision to obtain more detailed values. For example, height (150.5 cm, 162.3 cm) or temperature (22.5°C, 18.7°C).
  - **Discrete Variables:** Can take a limited number of values within a given range and are usually whole numbers. For example, number of students (15, 20) or number of rooms (1, 2).

## 2. Types of Variables by Value

### a. Continuous Variables

- **Continuous variables** can take an infinite number of values within a given range and are typically measurable characteristics. These variables can theoretically take an infinite number of values between any two measurements.
- **Examples:** Height, weight, temperature.

### b. Discrete Variables

- **Discrete variables** can take a limited number of values within a given range and are usually countable. These variables are expressed in specific intervals or whole numbers.
- **Examples:** Number of students, number of rooms, number of books.

**Note:** Quantitative variables can be either continuous or discrete. However, qualitative variables are always discrete because they consist of non-numeric categories.

## 3. Types of Variables by Cause-and-Effect

### a. Dependent Variable

- The **dependent variable** is the one affected by changes in independent variables in a study or experiment. It measures the effect of changes in independent variables.
- **Examples:** In evaluating the effect of a training program, the student's performance score is the dependent variable.

### b. Independent Variable

- The **independent variable** is the one that is changed or controlled in a study or experiment to test its effect on the dependent variable. These variables are the factors that influence other variables.
- **Examples:** Teaching methods applied during the same training program are the independent variables.

These categories play a fundamental role in data analysis and the selection of statistical methods, helping to define the meaning and analysis of variables.
