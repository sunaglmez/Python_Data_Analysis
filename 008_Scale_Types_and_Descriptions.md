# Scale Types and Descriptions

Different types of scales are used for classifying and analyzing data. These scales determine the characteristics of the data and the mathematical operations that can be performed. Here are the various scale types and their descriptions:

## 1. Classification - Nominal Scale

- **Description:** The nominal scale is used to categorize data without implying any ordering or ranking among the categories. This scale simply defines categories and provides information about differences between them.
- **Example:** Gender, color, cities.
  - **Gender:** Male, Female. There is no ordering or ranking among these categories; each provides equal information.

## 2. Ranking - Ordinal Scale

- **Description:** The ordinal scale allows for ranking or ordering of data. This scale indicates the importance or magnitude differences between categories, but the intervals between categories may not be equal.
- **Example:** Education level, ranks.
  - **Education Level:** Elementary School, Middle School, High School, University. This ordering represents an increase in education level, though the intervals between them may not be equal.

## 3. Metric Scales

Metric scales involve numerical values and allow for mathematical operations. There are two main types:

### 3.1. Interval Scale

- **Description:** Interval scales can take both positive and negative values, with equal intervals between values. However, this scale does not have an absolute zero point; therefore, ratio calculations are not possible.
- **Example:** Temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit). 0Â°C is not considered a true starting point in the temperature scale.

### 3.2. Ratio Scale

- **Description:** Ratio scales have an absolute zero point and are expressed with numerical values. This scale includes both equal intervals and ratio calculations; hence, a zero value represents a true absence of the quantity.
- **Example:** Monthly income, weight. A zero income truly means an absence of income.

## NOTE:
- A higher scale type encompasses the characteristics of the lower scale types. For example, an ordinal scale includes both ranking and nominal features.
